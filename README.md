# MovieLib
HTML gallery for local movies and YouTube clips (for children)

![MovieLib Screenshot](https://github.com/ShaiFisher/MovieLib/blob/master/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

The page displays the movies thumbnails according to Json file.
(and a badge of number of play times).
It can display also a list of chapters in a series.

On click one of the movies, an Auto-It script that runs in the background is catching the click and run the movie.

Youtube clips are run in the page as embeded video.

Adding files:
When copying a video file or a Youtube address, the listener will catch it and ask for a title,
then add it to movies.js file.
